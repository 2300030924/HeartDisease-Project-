# Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning–based system that predicts the likelihood of heart disease
using patient clinical data.

This project focuses on applying data-driven techniques to assist early
detection and risk assessment in healthcare.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.
Early prediction using clinical parameters can help in timely diagnosis
and preventive care.

This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease
based on medical attributes.

## ⚙️ How the System Works
1. Patient medical parameters are provided as input  
2. Data is preprocessed and normalized  
3. The trained model evaluates risk patterns  
4. Prediction result is returned via a Flask backend
